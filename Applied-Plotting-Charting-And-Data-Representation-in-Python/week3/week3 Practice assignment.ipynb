    "# Practice Assignment: Understanding Distributions Through Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "** *This assignment is optional, and I encourage you to share your solutions with me and your peers in the discussion forums!* **\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this assignment, create a code cell that:\n",
    "* Creates a number of subplots using the `pyplot subplots` or `matplotlib gridspec` functionality.\n",
    "* Creates an animation, pulling between 100 and 1000 samples from each of the random variables (`x1`, `x2`, `x3`, `x4`) for each plot and plotting this as we did in the lecture on animation.\n",
    "* **Bonus:** Go above and beyond and \"wow\" your classmates (and me!) by looking into matplotlib widgets and adding a widget which allows for parameterization of the distributions behind the sampling animations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Tips:\n",
    "* Before you start, think about the different ways you can create this visualization to be as interesting and effective as possible.\n",
    "* Take a look at the histograms below to get an idea of what the random variables look like, as well as their positioning with respect to one another. This is just a guide, so be creative in how you lay things out!\n",
    "* Try to keep the length of your animation reasonable (roughly between 10 and 30 seconds)."
